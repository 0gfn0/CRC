## About The Project
</div>
<p align="center">
    This project presents the implementation of the basic version of CRC8, CRC-16/CMS and CRC-32/CKSUM
    CRC is based on division. The actual input data is interpreted as one long binary bit stream (dividend) which is divided by another fixed binary number (divisor). The remainder of this division is the checksum value. However, reality is a bit more complicated. The binary numbers (dividend and divisor) are not treated as normal integer values, but as binary polyonimals where the actual bits are used as coefficients.
